# SimpleLevelSystem
 A simple level system for Counter-Strike 2 maps
 
 Includes a compiled .vpk and raw .vmap files

This system works using a math_counter stored within the 3D Skybox map file. Since the 3D Skybox is now permanent, you can save entity states and interact with the entities from the main map file.
